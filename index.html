            </header>  
            <p>I'm passionate about technology, planning, and coding. Currently, I'm a student in Thinkful's <b>Full Stack Development</b> program, building mobile-first applications using the MERN stack and learning from senior developers. Before that, I worked in <b>Technical Program Management</b> for almost 5 years, collaborating with clients, developers, and sales/marketing to get features & products built, with goals to drive new customers and delight existing ones.</p>
            <p><b>Technical</b></p>
            <p>Analytical, data-driven, and always curious, I love that the technical side challenges me in these ways. Even before the bootcamp, I've had experience in:</p>

                    <h3>Basic Science Quiz</h3>
                    <p>This quiz was built to test users on basic science concepts and give more background into any concepts they may not remember.</p>
                    <p>It's for anyone whose taken even just one intro level science class, and I made it to help remind people of some of the common concepts you see in every day life.</p>
                    <p><b>Technologies Used: </b> jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>
                    <p><b>Wireframes: </b>Normally I wireframe in Balsamiq, but for this project, I put together <a href="https://omaiyea.github.io/quiz-app-wireframes/" target="_blank">live HTML wireframes.</a></p>
                    <p><b>Future Directions: </b>From user testing, for most this quiz was probably too easy. In the future I'd like to present progressively harder questions, still keeping it approachable for some while also challenging those with more background.</p>

                    <h3>What Should I Cook?</h3>
                    <p>Hungry users can easily decide what to cook without getting overwhelmed with options, using this app. If they can't choose what to cook from a limited set of recipes, they are returned restaurants nearby or can choose to see more recipes.</p> 
                    <p><b>Technologies Used: </b> jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>
                    <p><b>Research: </b>Most recipe apps have endless scrolling, which is nice for exploring new recipes, but doesn't always help users who are hungry and need to decide on what to cook ASAP.</p>
                    <p><b>Wireframes: </b>I also put together <a href="https://github.com/omaiyea/cook-app-wireframes" target="_blank">live HTML wireframes.</a> for this project.</p>
                    <p><b>User Stories: </b> Because I'm part PM, I had to put together <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P45adHSOQQZuusFKTzHsrKBGm9RUM7hkjGx0MBl0bHU/edit#gid=0">user stories</a> for this to help guide development. They changed a bit after getting user feedback on the initial wireframes.</p>
